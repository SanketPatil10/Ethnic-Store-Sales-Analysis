# Ethnic-Store-Sales-Analysis

ðŸ§© Problem Overview:
An ethnic store sells through different channels - potentially both online and in person - but the owner does not have one, comprehensive view of the overall performance of the store.
Sales data is fragmented across various systems and platforms, making it very challenging to:
 
1. Identify customer segments (age group, gender, region, etc.) that are generating the most revenue. 
2. Identify product category (clothing, jewelry or home dÃ©cor) that realized the largest revenue. 
3. Identify which sales platforms (website, mobile app or the physical store) are producing the best results. 
4. The inability to bring together data, leaves the business and owner unable to make effective data-driven determinations on inventory, marketing and targeting customers.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective: 
This project seeks to analyze and categorize sales data in a meaningful way so the business owner can: 
1. Gain a clear, unified view of performance across all sales channels.  
2. Detect patterns in consumer preferences, popular product categories, and most lucrative platforms.  
3. Make better decisions that lead to increased revenue and effective use of resources.

ðŸ“Œ Tasks Performed:
1. Data Cleaning & Integration:
Collected raw sales data from different origins (e.g. an ecommerce site, a retail store).
Removed duplicates, handled empty cells, and made sure the data was consistently formatted.

2. Data Transformation:
Created calculated columns for measures such as total revenue, profit margin and number of orders.
Created mappings of customer information, grouping variables and identifiers of channels.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explored the sales data over time, by category, region, and customer demographic.
Highlighted most significant segments and product sales.

4. Dashboard Development:
Developed interactive dashboards using Excel.
Provided filters and slicers to enable dynamic analysis, e.g. by product, year, or region.
